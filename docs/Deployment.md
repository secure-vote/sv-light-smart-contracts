# Deployment of SVLight

## Prep

Initial prep needed:

* Own an ENS domain - decide what domain you'd like the index to live at.
* Deploy `EnsOwnerProxy` with parameters:
  * `constructor(bytes32 _ensNode, ENSIface _ens, PublicResolver _resolver)`
  * `_ensNode` should be the node of the ENS domain the index will live at. Example: `index.tokenvote.eth` corresponds to `0x5bc52185477f1fb191d0a118f3f0a82d0032bc283c62f0f818a0ddee0127d9ba`
* Set the owner of the domain to the `EnsOwnerProxy` (you can recover the domain)

## Main Deploy

**WARNING:** if you would like to deploy the index in such a way that the code can be verified through etherscan you should use `solidity_flattener` to generate the `.sol` file, use `solc` to compile that with whatever flags, and then deploy _that_ code, not the code provided to you when deploying the index below. Note, however, that you will need to ensure the constructor arguments are correctly attached to the index when deploying.

**Actual Deployment**

You can use `./bin/deploy-ix-full.js` to deploy the contract. Be sure to check `--help`. Be sure to provide:
* emergency payments addr
* the owner addr if deploying manually
* ensOwnerPx address
* the ens domain being used
* `--fresh`


In order these are deployed:

* SVIndexBackend
* SVPayments
* BBFarm
* CommunityAuction
* Index

Then you'll need to set permissions on:

* Backend
* Payments
* BBFarm
* EnsOwnerPx

And finally set the ens addr to resolve to the index.
